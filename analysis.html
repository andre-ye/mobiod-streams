<h1>Analysis</h1>

The world you watch is one of the symbolic. It's not so rich... but it is liberating too. We are free and responsible.

Subjectivity: we will never be able to fully relinquish our subjectivity. But if we can do part it: it's something beautiful.

Associative logics, leaning into the symbolic.
