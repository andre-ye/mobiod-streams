<h1>Analysis: The Poverty and Potential of the Symbolic</h1>

Can finish before deadline also

It's tiring. 

Let us begin with the world.

<bold>Overarching vision.</bold> Hmm...

<bold>Metaphysics and Nature.</bold> This world is not so physically rich and full as that of other world-builders, but it has important physical properties which are meaningful to analyze. ...

<bold>Culture, Mythology, and Subjectivity.</bold>

The world you watch is one of the symbolic. It's not so rich... but it is liberating too. We are free and responsible.

Subjectivity: we will never be able to fully relinquish our subjectivity. But if we can do part it: it's something beautiful.

Associative logics, leaning into the symbolic.
