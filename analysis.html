<h1>Analysis: The Poverty and Potential of the Symbolic</h1>

Can finish before deadline also

It's tiring. 

Let us begin with the world.

<bold>Overarching vision.</bold> Hmm...

<bold>Metaphysics and Nature.</bold> This world is not so physically rich and full as that of other world-builders, but it has important physical properties which are meaningful to analyze. Words exist as matter exists in our world, and words relate as matter relates. There is an associative logic employed. 

<bold>Culture, Mythology, and Subjectivity.</bold>

The world you watch is one of the symbolic. It's not so rich... but it is liberating too. We are free and responsible.

Subjectivity: we will never be able to fully relinquish our subjectivity. But if we can do part it: it's something beautiful.

Associative logics, leaning into the symbolic.
