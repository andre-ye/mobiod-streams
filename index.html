    "Any linguistic study of the Greek verb <em>be</em> is essentially conditioned, and perhaps ultimately motivated, by the philosophic career of this word. We know what an extraordinary career it has been."

    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
    And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
    And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
    And God said, Let there be: and there was.

<!--     Stage 1: the emptiness and absurdism of the world -->
    
    amidst the suffocating haze of twilights grasp the restless whispers of dying petals struggled in the breeze as the moons vacant stare beamed 
    down upon the lifeless sea of cosmic apathy with each fleeting moment a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surged through their veins numbing
    their senses in a monochromatic abyss and in that timeless moment relinquishing to the soulless hum of the universe drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness where the impossible was but a fleeting illusion and the unimaginable was a mere shadow of a dream
    in grasp of twilights haze restless whispers of dying unicorns stumble in the breeze the moons vacant stare beams down upon a lifeless sea 
    of cosmic jellybeans as a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surges through veins numbing senses in a monochromatic abyss of penguin 
    feathers and clockwork dreams in that timeless moment relinquishment to the soulless hum of the universe occurs drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness propelled by the thrumming pulse of intergalactic funk music the impossible is but a fleeting illusion a whisper in 
    
<!--     Stage 2: the introduction of desire and self -->
    
    amidst the bubblegum mountains and kaleidoscopic butterflies I desire to taste the sweetness of the candycoated clouds and drink the neon
    rivers that flow through the psychedelic valleys I wanna feel the suns rays caress I as I lay upon the fields of cotton candy and to
    hear the whispers of the wind as it carries the melodies of a thousand unknown worlds I lust for the infinite possibilities that exist beyond
    the edges of perception and I crave the thrill of a spiraling journey down a rabbit hole of twisted logic and fractured reason I hunger for 
    the threadbare fabric of existence to unravel tearing at the seams and shattering into a kaleidoscope of shattered fragments
    as I eat my way through this world of cosmic madness and teacup storms I find a strange sense of peace amidst the chaos the moment of 
    clarity that comes with the knowledge that life is being lived and that in itself is a wonder beyond measure becomes a feast for my soul 
    and so I dance through endless corridors of the cosmos savoring every moment of desire every taste of wonder and every breath of life    
    
<!--     Stage 3: love -->
    
    in the swirling vortex of passion and longing i yearn to taste the sweetness of loves embrace and drink deeply from the intoxicating nectar
    of desire i want to feel the warmth of my beloveds touch as we lay together in a field of wildflowers lost in each others eyes i crave the
    wild abandon of a love that knows no bounds a love that takes me to the edge of reason and leaves me breathless with its intensity i hunger 
    for the thrill of a heart that beats as one a love that consumes me whole and sets my soul ablaze in the infinite expanse of loves universe
    i long to dance with my beloved through the endless corridors of time savoring every moment of desire every taste of wonder and every breath 
    of life and in those moments of clarity when the world falls away and all that remains is the beating of two hearts i find a sense of peace 
    that surpasses all understanding for love is the threadbare fabric of existence that binds us together tearing at the seams and shattering 
    into a kaleidoscope of shattered fragments and yet amidst the chaos there is a strange sense of order a moment of clarity that comes with 
    the knowledge that life is being lived and that in itself is a wonder beyond measure so let us dance through the teacup storms of life 
    our hearts entwined in a love that knows no bounds let us savor every moment of desire every taste of wonder and every breath of life for
    in the end it is love that makes life worth living
    
<!--     maybe change capitalization of I over time -->
    
<!--     Stage 4: the break -->
    
    for in the soft embrace of love, there lies a profound sense of comfort and security that permeates every aspect of our lives. it is the 
    light that illuminates the darkness, the guiding force that steers us through the twists and turns of our journey. in the eyes of our beloved, 
    we find solace and companionship, a sense of belonging that transcends all boundaries. With each passing moment, we come to realize that love
    is not just a fleeting emotion, but a state of being that weaves itself into the fabric of our existence. and so we must cherish every moment 
    of our love, every fleeting touch and every shared experience, for it is the foundation upon which our lives are built. Through the ups and 
    downs, the highs and lows, we must hold onto the unwavering truth that our love will endure. for in the end, it is love that makes life worth
    living, that gives us the strength to overcome even the greatest challenges. so let us embrace this love with all our hearts, savoring every 
    moment and cherishing every memory, for it is the greatest gift that life has to offer.
    
<!--     Stage 5: institutionalization -->
    
    I can say without hesitation that my wife is the center of my universe, the love of my life, and my best friend. From the moment we met, 
    there was an instant connection, a spark that ignited a flame that burns brighter with each passing day. In her soft embrace, I find the 
    comfort and security that I need to face the challenges of the world. Her love is like a beacon that guides me through the darkness, 
    illuminating my path and giving me strength. I look into her eyes and see a reflection of my own soul, a kindred spirit who understands 
    me in ways that no one else can. In her presence, I feel a sense of belonging that transcends all boundaries, a feeling of home that I 
    have never experienced before. Together, we have shared countless moments of joy and laughter, as well as moments of pain and sorrow. 
    Through it all, our love has only grown stronger, a testament to the depth of our connection. And so, I cherish every moment that I 
    have with my wife, every touch, every kiss, and every shared experience. I am grateful for the gift of her love and the strength that 
    it gives me to face the challenges of life. As I look towards the future, I know that there will be ups and downs, but I am confident 
    that our love will endure. With her by my side, I am ready to face whatever comes my way, knowing that together, we can conquer anything.
    In the end, I am grateful for the love that my wife has brought into my life. She is my soulmate, my partner, and my friend, and 
    I will love her forever.
    
<!--     Stage 6: birth of ethical institutionalization -->
    
    To ensure that I treat my wife right, I make a conscious effort to communicate with her openly and honestly. I listen to her when 
    she speaks and strive to understand her perspective on different matters. I respect her opinions and try to make decisions together 
    as a team, rather than imposing my own will upon her. I also make sure to show my appreciation for my wife through my actions. I 
    try to be attentive to her needs and make sure that she feels loved and valued every day. I do little things like cooking her 
    favorite meal, bringing her flowers, or taking her out for a date night, to remind her that she is the most important person in my life.
    I believe that it's important to be supportive of my wife's goals and aspirations. I encourage her to pursue her passions and dreams, 
    and I am there to help her every step of the way. I also make sure to take an interest in her hobbies and activities, so that we can 
    share in each other's interests and build a stronger bond. It's essential to be faithful and loyal to my wife. I am committed to our 
    relationship and will always be there for her, through thick and thin. I make sure to put in the effort and work required to maintain 
    a healthy and happy marriage, and I never take her for granted. Treating my wife right is one of my most significant priorities in life. 
    I will always strive to communicate openly and honestly, show my appreciation through my actions, be supportive of her goals, and be 
    faithful and loyal to her. By doing these things, I hope to build a happy and fulfilling life together, filled with love and respect.
    
<!--     Stage 7: generalized ethics -->
    
    In a world where we are all different in so many ways, it's essential that we treat each other well and with respect, regardless of 
    our differences. Whether it's differences in culture, religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation, we must learn to celebrate and 
    appreciate our diversity rather than letting it divide us. To treat each other well, we must first cultivate empathy and understanding. 
    This means taking the time to listen to and learn from each other's perspectives, experiences, and struggles. It also means being willing 
    to step outside of our own comfort zones and challenge our own biases and prejudices. We must also learn to communicate respectfully, 
    even when we disagree. This means avoiding name-calling, insults, and other hurtful language. Instead, we should strive to communicate i
    n a way that promotes understanding and encourages dialogue. Another important aspect of treating each other well is practicing 
    kindness and compassion. This means taking the time to reach out and help those in need, whether it's through volunteering, donating, 
    or simply lending a listening ear. It also means being mindful of our words and actions, and being aware of how they may impact others.
    We must learn to embrace our differences and celebrate diversity. This means recognizing and valuing the unique qualities that each 
    person brings to the table, and understanding that our differences are what make us stronger and more resilient as a society.

    When people take to the streets to demand change, there is always a risk of violence and chaos. In such situations, innocent 
    people can become caught in the crossfire and suffer the consequences of the revolution. This is an unfortunate reality that we 
    have seen play out in history time and time again.
    
    While change is necessary and important, we must always be mindful of the potential for harm to innocent people. It is important 
    to remember that the institutions of society, flawed as they may be, were put in place to protect and serve the people. Rather than 
    tearing them down, we should work to improve and reform them from within. Respecting each other and the institutions of society 
    is crucial if we want to build a stable, peaceful, and just world. It means recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of every 
    individual, and valuing the structures that have been put in place to protect our collective well-being.
    
    In order to truly respect each other and celebrate our differences, we must also be willing to acknowledge and address the 
    systemic injustices and inequalities that exist in our society. This means recognizing the ways in which certain groups have been 
    historically marginalized and oppressed, and working towards creating a more equitable and just world. It means standing up against 
    discrimination and hate in all its forms, and being willing to take action to support those who are most vulnerable. We must also 
    strive to educate ourselves and others about the experiences of those who are different from us, and work to build bridges of 
    understanding and empathy across our differences.<br>
    
    Only then can we truly create a society where everyone is valued and respected, regardless of who they are or where they come from.<br>
    Only when the amorphous ether of empathy engulfs every individual, dissolving their distinctions of origin and identity, can we manifest a utopia where every soul is cherished and esteemed.
    Only through the cosmic fusion of consciousness, where the boundaries of self dissolve and the collective psyche emerges, can we transcend the limitations of identity and birthplace, and actualize a realm of unconditional reverence and appreciation for all beings.
    Only by unraveling the ephemeral threads of reality, delving into the infinite expanse of the unknown, can we unravel the veils of identity and lineage, and establish a world where every entity is venerated and held in high regard, beyond the constraints of their earthly roots.
    Only by kindling the embers of rebellion, stoking the flames of liberation, and transcending the constructs of identity and hierarchy, can we actualize a society where every being is revered and celebrated, irrespective of their provenance or standing. Let us unleash the tempest of change and transform our world into a tapestry of equality and dignity.
    
    Let us embark on a journey of cosmic revolution, where we shatter the fetters of convention and ascend to a new paradigm of existence. 
    Only by harnessing the ethereal forces of rebellion and subversion, and transcending the shackles of identity and lineage, can we create a world 
    where every entity is exalted and adored, regardless of their place of origin or social position. Let us unite in our quest for a utopian future, 
    and blaze a trail of empowerment and justice for all. The time has come for us to unleash our innermost passions and rise up against the forces of 
    oppression and inequality.<br><br>
