    "Any linguistic study of the Greek verb <em>be</em> is essentially conditioned, and perhaps ultimately motivated, by the philosophic career of this word. We know what an extraordinary career it has been."

    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. <br>
    And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. <br>
    And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. <br>
    And God said, Let there be: and there was.

    amidst the suffocating haze of twilights grasp the restless whispers of dying petals struggled in the breeze as the moons vacant stare beamed 
    down upon the lifeless sea of cosmic apathy with each fleeting moment a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surged through their veins numbing
    their senses in a monochromatic abyss and in that timeless moment relinquishing to the soulless hum of the universe drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness where the impossible was but a fleeting illusion and the unimaginable was a mere shadow of a dream
    in grasp of twilights haze restless whispers of dying unicorns stumble in the breeze the moons vacant stare beams down upon a lifeless sea 
    of cosmic jellybeans as a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surges through veins numbing senses in a monochromatic abyss of penguin 
    feathers and clockwork dreams in that timeless moment relinquishment to the soulless hum of the universe occurs drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness propelled by the thrumming pulse of intergalactic funk music the impossible is but a fleeting illusion a whisper in 
    the wind of a world of bubblegum mountains and kaleidoscopic butterflies while the unimaginable is a mere shadow of a dream a fleeting glimpse 
    of a dimension beyond the edges of perception as a spiraling journey down a rabbit hole of twisted logic and fractured reason unfolds the 
    threadbare fabric of existence is clung to a flimsy lifeline in a world of cosmic madness and teacup storms but even as the very fabric of 
    the universe seems to unravel tearing at the seams and shattering into a kaleidoscope of shattered fragments a strange sense of peace is found 
    a moment of clarity amidst the maelstrom of chaos can be beautiful in its own twisted distorted way and as the dance through endless corridors
    of the cosmos commences the knowledge that life is being lived and that in itself is a wonder beyond measure becomes apparent
