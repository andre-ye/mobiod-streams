  Mobiod Streams
</h1>

<p>
Morphemes, symbols, words: these are the atoms, the elemental matter. These particles cannot be studied under a microscope – stunned, killed, isolated, and examined by the cold gaze of the scientist. No, these particles travel far too much and far too quickly. Gravity pushes the particles into parallel linear streams, rushing in and out of existence to destinations unknown. The universe is exactly this: structured bands of elements moving all too fast.
