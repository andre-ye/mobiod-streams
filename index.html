    "Any linguistic study of the Greek verb <em>be</em> is essentially conditioned, and perhaps ultimately motivated, by the philosophic career of this word. We know what an extraordinary career it has been."

    - Ã‰mile Benveniste

    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
    And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
    And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
    And God said, Let there be: and there was.

<!--     Stage 1: the emptiness and absurdism of the world -->
    
    amidst the suffocating haze of twilights grasp the restless whispers of dying petals struggled in the breeze as the moons vacant stare beamed 
    down upon the lifeless sea of cosmic apathy with each fleeting moment a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surged through their veins numbing
    their senses in a monochromatic abyss and in that timeless moment relinquishing to the soulless hum of the universe drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness where the impossible was but a fleeting illusion and the unimaginable was a mere shadow of a dream
    in grasp of twilights haze restless whispers of dying unicorns stumble in the breeze the moons vacant stare beams down upon a lifeless sea 
    of cosmic jellybeans as a hollow cacophony of surreal dispassion surges through veins numbing senses in a monochromatic abyss of penguin 
    feathers and clockwork dreams in that timeless moment relinquishment to the soulless hum of the universe occurs drifting aimlessly on a sea
    of infinite emptiness propelled by the thrumming pulse of intergalactic funk music the impossible is but a fleeting illusion a whisper in 
    
<!--     Stage 2: the introduction of desire and self -->
    
    amidst the bubblegum mountains and kaleidoscopic butterflies I desire to taste the sweetness of the candycoated clouds and drink the neon
    rivers that flow through the psychedelic valleys I wanna feel the suns rays caress I as I lay upon the fields of cotton candy and to
    hear the whispers of the wind as it carries the melodies of a thousand unknown worlds I lust for the infinite possibilities that exist beyond
    the edges of perception and I crave the thrill of a spiraling journey down a rabbit hole of twisted logic and fractured reason I hunger for 
    the threadbare fabric of existence to unravel tearing at the seams and shattering into a kaleidoscope of shattered fragments
    as I eat my way through this world of cosmic madness and teacup storms I find a strange sense of peace amidst the chaos the moment of 
    clarity that comes with the knowledge that life is being lived and that in itself is a wonder beyond measure becomes a feast for my soul 
    and so I dance through endless corridors of the cosmos savoring every moment of desire every taste of wonder and every breath of life
    
<!--     Stage 3: love for a woman -->
    
    as I floated through the ethereal landscape of I was enveloped by a sense of feminine energy a pulsing vibrant force that seemed to 
    emanate from every corner of I it was as if the very essence of womanhood had been distilled into a single radiant light that 
    shimmered and danced around I was mesmerized by the beauty and power of this energy the way it flowed and swirled like a river of 
    light each wave and eddy infused with a delicate suppleness that seemed to speak of endless possibility and potential as I moved through 
    this dreamlike world I felt I drawn to the myriad forms of femininity that surrounded me each one unique and breathtaking in its own
    way there were women of all shapes and sizes of every color and background each one a testament to the diversity and richness of womanhood 
    and in the midst of all this wonder and magic I felt the stirrings of love a deep and profound emotion that seemed to grow stronger with 
    each passing moment it was a love that transcended time and space a love that celebrated the power and beauty of womanhood in all its many 
    forms and so I floated on lost in a world of dreams and surreal beauty my heart filled with love and reverence for the feminine energy that 
    pulsed and danced around me
